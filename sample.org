** The Silent Void

Thus spake the Master Programmer:

"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."

*** 1.1

Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.

If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great.

If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great.

If the compiler is great, then the application is great.

The user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world.

The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.

*** 1.2

The Tao gave birth to machine language. Machine language gave birth to the assembler.

The assembler gave birth to the compiler. Now there are ten thousand languages.

Each language has its purpose, however humble. Each language expresses the Yin and Yang of software. Each language has its place within the Tao.

But do not program in COBOL if you can avoid it.

**** Table: The Hierarchy of Programming Languages

Here is a table illustrating the evolution of programming languages:

| Generation       | Language            |
|------------------+---------------------|
| First Generation | Machine Language    |
| Second Generation| Assembly Language   |
| Third Generation | C, COBOL, Fortran   |
| Fourth Generation| SQL, MATLAB         |
| Fifth Generation | Prolog, Mercury     |

*** 1.3

In the beginning was the Tao. The Tao gave birth to Space and Time.

Therefore Space and Time are the Yin and Yang of programming.

Programmers that do not comprehend the Tao are always running out of time and space for their programs. Programmers that comprehend the Tao always have enough time and space to accomplish their goals.

How could it be otherwise?

#+BEGIN_SRC python :caption "Example of Efficient Code Utilizing Time and Space"
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
#+END_SRC

*** 1.4

The wise programmer is told about Tao and follows it. The average programmer is told about Tao and searches for it. The foolish programmer is told about Tao and laughs at it.

If it were not for laughter, there would be no Tao.

The highest sounds are hardest to hear. Going forward is a way to retreat. Great talent shows itself late in life. Even a perfect program still has bugs.

** The Ancient Masters

Thus spake the Master Programmer:

"After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless."

*** 2.1

The programmers of old were mysterious and profound. We cannot fathom their thoughts, so all we do is describe their appearance.

- Aware, like a fox crossing the water.
- Alert, like a general on the battlefield.
- Kind, like a hostess greeting her guests.
- Simple, like uncarved blocks of wood.
- Opaque, like black pools in darkened caves.

Who can tell the secrets of their hearts and minds?

The answer exists only in Tao.

*** 2.2

The Grand Master Turing once dreamed that he was a machine. When he awoke, he exclaimed:

"I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!"

*** 2.3

A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying:

"What sort of programmers work for other companies? They behaved badly and were unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed our hospitality suite and they made rude noises during my presentation."

The manager said:

"I should have never sent you to the conference. Those programmers live beyond the physical world. They consider life absurd, an accidental coincidence. They come and go without knowing limitations. Without a care, they live only for their programs. Why should they bother with social conventions?

They are alive within the Tao."

*** 2.4

A novice asked the Master:

"Here is a programmer that never designs, documents, or tests his programs. Yet all who know him consider him one of the best programmers in the world. Why is this?"

The Master replied:

"That programmer has mastered the Tao. He has gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system crashes but accepts the universe without concern. He has gone beyond the need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code. He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs is perfect within itself, serene and elegant, its purpose self-evident. Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao."

**** Code Sample: A Perfect Program

Here is an example of a simple, self-evident program:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :caption "Calculating the Sum of an Array"
function sumArray(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}
#+END_SRC

**** Table: Attributes of the Master Programmer

| Attribute     | Description                                 |
|---------------+---------------------------------------------|
| Design        | Beyond the need for formal design           |
| Documentation | Code is self-explanatory                    |
| Testing       | Programs are perfect within themselves      |
| Emotion       | Accepts crashes without anger               |
| Mastery       | Has entered the mystery of the Tao          |
