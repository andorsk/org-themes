# org-brew

I like homebrew theme. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Homebrew.itermcolors
I also like org mode. This makes org mode and brew play nice.

This is heavily inspired by https://fniessen.github.io/org-html-themes and in some cases, blatantly copied over with modifications. 

Here's a few sample:
